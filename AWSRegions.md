# AWS Regions

* AWS has regions all round the world (us-east-1, eu-west-3)
* A region is a cluster of data centers
* Most AWS services are region-scoped

## How tho choose an AWS region?

It depends on:

* Compliance
* Proximity and latency
* Available services
* Pricing

## Availability Zones

* Each region has many AZs (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6)
* Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity
* They are separate from each other
* They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

## Edge Locations

* Amazon has 200+ points of presence (edge locations and regional caches) in several cities and countries
* Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
