# IAM Introduction

* IAM = Identity and Access Management
* It is a **Global Service**
* Root account is created by default. Shouldn't be used or shared
* Users are people withing your organization
* Groups only contain users, not other groups
* User's don't have to belong to a group
* User's can belong to multiple groups

## Permissions

* Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
* Policies define the **permissions** of the users
* In AWS you apply the **least privilege principle** (don't give more permissions than needed)
