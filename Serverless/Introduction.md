# Introduction

* A new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore
* Just deploy code!
* Initially serverless meant (Function as a Service)
* Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed like databases, messaging, storage, etc.
* Serverless does not mean there are no servers, you just don't manage them

## Examples

* AWS Lambda
* DynamoDB
* AWS Cognito
* AWS API Gateway
* Amazon S3
* AWS SNS and SQS
* AWS Kinesis Data Firehose
* Aurora Serverless
* Step Functions
* Fargate
